The Song Recommendation Tool is a hybrid Music Recommender System in the form of a web application, where users can get music recommendations based on explicit preferences. Users input songs and rate them, input different parameters to influence their recommendations, then receive their recommendations and if they would like to they can create a Spotify Playlist populated with them. The application combines a user-friendly and visually appealing Front-end with a Back-end focused on Data Science that processes input data and derives recommendations.
